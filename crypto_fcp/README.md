## üéØ Mission Statement

This repository serves as the authoritative source for OBINexus technical proposals, architectural specifications, and innovation frameworks. Each proposal represents a systematic approach to solving complex technical challenges through mathematically grounded, governance-first design principles.

**Core Philosophy:** *Theory without application is a map without a destination.*

## üìã Repository Structure

### Current Proposals

#### üîê Foundation Cipher Protocol (FCP)
**Location:** `crypto_fcp/`  
**Status:** Phase 1 Implementation  
**Lead:** Nnamdi Michael Okpala

A structural cryptographic validator that provides trust-by-structure rather than trust-by-authority. FCP operates as a mathematically grounded integrity mechanism for distributed systems, offering O(1) verification with O(2^n) forgery resistance.

**Key Features:**
- Divisor Echo Validation Algorithm
- Distributed Entropy Architecture  
- Multi-language bindings (Python, Lua, Rust, C)
- JSON-driven configuration interface
- Zero external dependencies
